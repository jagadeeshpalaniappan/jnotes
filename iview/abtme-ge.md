Apart from my daily work, I always go out of the box and think, innovate new ideas, develop prototypes, POCs to solve real-time problems.


- In GE,
````js
- I have developed a POC —to control Web Application using voice (Alexa)
- which means you can speak (Alexa) to control your web application
    - with your own natural language
    
- And I won, GE Award for that "Learn and Adapt To Win"
````






- In my previous company Cisco,
````js
- I have developed a 'Hyperion -Monitor System' to monitor the Hyperion Application
- it connects multiple unix and windows boxes and monitors the Hyperion systems.
- Previously there was a dedicated Engineer manually monitors and send emails.
- This application automated the entire process
````

- In my free time,

````js
- TODO: ```I also develop some useful applications and hobby projects ```
- I also **volunteer** and take 'free classes' to college students (to give back my knowledge to society)
````

All these activities motivates me to learn and keep up-to-date with latest technologies.
