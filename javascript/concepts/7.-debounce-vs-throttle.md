# 7. Debounce vs Throttle

**Debounce** and **throttle** are two similar \(but different!\) techniques 

* to control 'how many times'
* we allow a **function** to be **executed** over time.

The main difference between **Throttling** and **Debouncing** is that 

* throttle **`guarantees`** the `execution` of the function regularly, 
  * at least every X milliseconds.
* debounce does NOT,
  * `LastCall --> wait for X milliseconds --> if no new request ==> call the fun`

```javascript
_.throttle(function() {
    // every 1000ms it --> call 'expensiveFn'
    expensiveFn();
}, 1000)
```

```javascript
_.debounce(function() {
    // lastCall + wait 1000ms
    // (if no new request comes within this wait time) it --> calls 'expensiveFn'
    expensiveFn();
}, 1000)
```

\*\*\*\*

* **Throttle:** 
  * `every 1000ms --> call 'expensiveFn'`  
  * \(irrespective of user completed the action fully or not -- it calls every 1000ms \)
  * it doesn't wait for user actions to complete
* **Debounce:** 
  * `lastCall --> wait 1000ms -->`
  * `(if no new rqst comes within this wait time) it --> calls 'display_info'`
  * * \(after user completed the action fully\) \(call expensiveFn\)
    * How do you identify that? \(using 'wait time'\)
    * In this **wait time,** if [no new changes](../todo.md) user made,
      *  ---&gt; we can assume that 'that is last change user made'
    * then immediately call the _actual fn_









Debounce:

* when it is being called continuously 
* and we want it to execute after a certain period 

  * if time has passed since the last call.

* \*\*\*\*

```javascript
const debounce = (func, delay) => {
  let inDebounce
  return function() {
    const context = this
    const args = arguments
    clearTimeout(inDebounce)
    inDebounce = setTimeout(() => func.apply(context, args), delay)
  }
}
```



**Short-form:**

```javascript
function debounce(func, waitTime) {
    var timeout;

    return function () {
        clearTimeout(timeout);
        timeout = setTimeout(func, waitTime);
    };
};
```



### **Throttle**

This technique is more aptly named. Throttling a function comes in handy when it is being called continuously and we want it to execute once every _x_ seconds. A good example of this would be a scroll handler or a resize handler, where we want to execute the handler once in a fixed time period even if the function is getting called continuously.
